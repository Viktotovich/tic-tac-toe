# tic-tac-toe
tic-tac-toe with vanilla JS

This is how I want the board to look like:
scoreboard scoreboard scoreboard
sidebar-p1 gameboard   sidebar-p2
    0      buttons          0"/*

To work on:
    Better scoreboard display.
    Fully fixing the null value bug.
    Wrong round/character display upon reset/restart
    (only the 1st 2 rounds, after it's normal)"

Soft colors of green and red-ish as display - or anything that is complementary to it. Project could be done as is, but has bugs - and is a visual 2001 throwback.
